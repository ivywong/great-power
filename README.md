this firefox browser extension lets you rearrange website elements to your liking by dragging them around.

google's homepage too clean and minimalist for you? fix it yourself!

<img src="doc/google.png" width=70% alt="google homepage but 'better' (elements all askew)">

not enough time to scroll through all of Mozilla's documentation? read it all at the same time!

<img src="doc/mdn.png" width=70% alt="MDN docs on drag and drop, but the first paragraphs are all overlaid on top of each other">

beware, these changes will stick around even after you reload. (but that's obviously a good thing)
